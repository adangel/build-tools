Release Howto for pmd-build:
============================

Prerequisites:
--------------
* You need to use SVN currently (git / git-svn is not supported at the moment)
* You need to have a Jira account at Sonatype: https://issues.sonatype.org/
* You need to have upload permissions to the staging repository for PMD at sonatype: https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-2295
* For more infos: https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
* You need a GPG key for signing the artifacts. Use "gpg --list-keys" to see your available keys. Note: Your key must be
  available through various keyservers.
* You need to have your settings.xml filled:
  -> configure the property gpg.keyname and any other property for the maven-gpg-plugin (e.g. via a profile)
  -> configure the server section (you need to configure your sonatype jira account for server id "sonatype-nexus-staging").

Step by step:
-------------
1. Checkout trunk via svn:

svn co https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/trunk/maven-plugin-pmd-build
cd maven-plugin-pmd-build
 
2. Prepare the release (creates a new release tag in SVN).
   This will be done for you: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/prepare-release.html
   Maven will ask you about the release version, the tag name and the new version. You can simply hit enter,
   to use the default values.

mvn release:clean
mvn release:prepare

3. Perform the release (builds from the tag and deploys the artifact).

mvn release:perform


4. Release it via Sonatype Nexus
 * Login to https://oss.sonatype.org/
 * Go to Staging Repositories page
 * Select a staging repository
 * Click the close button
